Anonutopia: A Smart Contract Based Cryptocountry

########
Abstract
########

This paper proposes a way to establish a decentralized social system based on available information technologies. The idea develops in several interconnected stages. The first step is creation of an alternative monetary a system based on a stable cryptocurrency (a.k.a. stable coin) pegged 1:1 to some fiat currency.  The next step includes developing services such as ATMs, fiscal cash registers, transport and accommodation solutions as starting points of a stable coin-based real economy. This is followed by establishing social services such as universal basice income, universal healthcare, and easily accessible education. The future directions comprise spreading to other economic sectors such sa food distribution and production, energy, communications, and other social services. The open-ended nature of this social system and the course of its development is determined by a delegative democratic system of government, recently known as "liquid democracy".

Throughout human history, political revolutions have emerged as consequences of technological revolutions which opened new possibilities of human action and interaction. An invention can bring forward a technological revolution if it radically changes existing or creates new media of production and distribution of goods as well as communication. This has happened since the invention of tools as a medium of physical action in the environment all the way to the mass media of the 20th century, which propelled the process of globalization but also enabled the rise of totalitarian systems. 

We are currently participating in a revolution based on rapid development of information technologies. Due to the nature of digital communications, this revolution has almost instantaneous global effect
